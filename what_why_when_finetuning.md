# ü§ñ What, Why, and When of Fine-Tuning LLMs

This document dives deep into the purpose, methods, and appropriate scenarios for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). It also compares **Fine-Tuning** vs **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with real-world examples including the **Airline Chatbot**.

---

## üìå What is Fine-Tuning?

**Fine-tuning** refers to continuing the training of a pre-trained LLM on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to specialize it for a particular task.

For example, an LLM like `Mistral-7B` is trained on general internet data. But fine-tuning it on 30‚Äì1000 airline-specific customer queries makes it behave like an **Airline Support Bot**, capable of generating context-specific, relevant, and policy-compliant answers.

## üí° Why Fine-Tune a Model?

- **Domain Expertise**: Impart knowledge specific to airlines, medicine, law, finance, etc.
- **Style Adaptation**: Customize tone or format (e.g., formal vs casual responses)
- **Improve Accuracy**: Provide consistently correct responses for repetitive tasks
- **Offline/Private Models**: No need for dynamic search or database

## ‚è±Ô∏è When Should You Fine-Tune?

| Scenario                              | Recommendation |
|---------------------------------------|----------------|
| Repetitive tasks with known patterns  | ‚úÖ Fine-tuning  |
| Need for stylistic control            | ‚úÖ Fine-tuning  |
| Limited or no internet access         | ‚úÖ Fine-tuning  |
| Vast changing external knowledge base | ‚ùå Use RAG      |
| Regulatory or fact-intensive tasks    | ‚ùå Prefer RAG   |

## üõ´ Airline Example: Fine-Tuning vs RAG

### ‚úàÔ∏è Fine-Tuned Airline Bot

Dataset: 100 queries like:

- ‚ÄúBook a flight from Delhi to Dubai on 15 July‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúWhat is the baggage policy for international flights?‚Äù

Fine-tuned model learns to respond:

> ‚ÄúYou are allowed 2 checked bags (23kg each) and 1 cabin bag (7kg)‚Ä¶‚Äù

**‚úÖ Pros**:
- Fast, lightweight, no external lookup
- Always-on, pre-programmed responses

**‚ùå Cons**:
- Needs retraining if policies change
- Hard to cover all edge cases

### üß† RAG Airline Bot

- Uses a base LLM + retrieval from PDF/policy docs (e.g., airline_tnc.pdf)
- User asks: ‚ÄúWhat is the refund policy for business class tickets?‚Äù
- LLM retrieves the latest clause and generates answer

**‚úÖ Pros**:
- Always up-to-date with documents
- Easy to scale and adapt

**‚ùå Cons**:
- Slower response due to document search
- Needs document embedding and maintenance

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Fine-Tuning Techniques

### 1. **Full Fine-Tuning**
- Retrain all parameters of the base LLM
- Requires massive GPU & data
- Not memory-efficient

### 2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
- Add small trainable adapter layers to freeze most of the model
- Used via PEFT in Hugging Face
- Lightweight, fast, efficient

### 3. **QLoRA**
- Quantized LoRA (4-bit models)
- Train LLMs on a single GPU
- Ideal for budget setups

### 4. **Prompt Tuning / Prefix Tuning**
- Don‚Äôt change model weights; tune only soft prompt embeddings
- Useful for fast inference and limited task shifts

## üîÅ RAG vs Fine-Tuning Summary Table

| Feature            | Fine-Tuning                      | RAG                                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Cost               | High (once)                      | Medium (ongoing infra)                      |
| Data Update        | Requires retraining              | Dynamic, can update docs anytime            |
| Accuracy           | High for narrow domains          | High if docs are up-to-date                 |
| Use Case           | Static, repeated queries         | Dynamic, fact-based queries                 |
| Deployment         | Easy (single model)              | Needs vector DB, retriever, encoder, model  |

## ‚úÖ Best Use Cases

| Use Case                          | Prefer             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Airline FAQs                     | Fine-tuning        |
| E-commerce chatbot               | Fine-tuning        |
| Legal Assistant (latest laws)    | RAG                |
| Customer support with evolving KB| RAG                |
| Medical Triage Assistant         | Fine-tuning        |

## üìö Advanced Fine-Tuning Tools

- **Hugging Face PEFT**: LoRA, QLoRA support
- **Axolotl**: YAML-based LLM fine-tuning
- **ColossalAI / Deepspeed**: For large-scale distributed training
- **Lamini.ai**: Paid tool to fine-tune models quickly
- **Nomic Atlas**: Visual dataset explorer and fine-tuner
- **OpenRouter / Groq + Fine-Tune APIs**: APIs for hosted fine-tuning (WIP in many platforms)

---

## üß† Challenges in Fine-Tuning

- Requires good quality, diverse dataset
- Catastrophic forgetting if not careful
- High cost for larger models
- Evaluation is tricky: need human-in-the-loop or scoring metrics
- Lack of generalization on unseen queries

---

## ‚úÖ Tips

- Use LoRA or QLoRA for < 20K examples
- Consider RAG if your knowledge changes weekly
- Blend both: fine-tune on structure, RAG for facts

### üîö Conclusion

**Fine-tuning** and **RAG** are not competitors ‚Äî they are complementary. Choose based on data dynamics, cost, and accuracy needs. For airline chatbots, **fine-tuning** works for static FAQs and **RAG** is better for dynamic policies.
