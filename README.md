# Fine-Tuning with Google Flan-T5

This project fine-tunes the **`google/flan-t5-small`** language model on a custom airline policy and FAQ dataset to build a chatbot capable of answering various airline-related queries such as flight booking, status, baggage policies, cancellations, and more.

---

## Overview

The goal is to teach a pretrained sequence-to-sequence model to understand instructions and user inputs related to airline services and generate relevant, accurate responses.

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple examples, where each example contains:

- **Instruction**: A description of the user’s intent (e.g., "Book a flight").
- **Input**: The actual user query (e.g., "I want to book a flight from Delhi to Dubai on 15 July").
- **Output**: The expected chatbot response (e.g., "Sure! Booking a flight from Delhi to Dubai on 15 July. Please confirm your time preference.").

This dataset is formatted to cover a wide range of airline-related scenarios, including flight status, baggage rules, cancellations, seat preferences, refunds, and more.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

- The instruction and user input are combined into a single input text prompt in the format:
  
- The expected response is kept as the target label.

- This structure is converted into a format compatible with Hugging Face datasets for efficient processing.

---

### 2. Model and Tokenizer Loading

- The pretrained `google/flan-t5-small` model and its tokenizer are loaded. This model is a sequence-to-sequence transformer designed to generate text based on given instructions and inputs.

---

### 3. Tokenization

- Both the input text and the output labels are tokenized using the tokenizer.
- Tokenization includes padding and truncation to a fixed maximum sequence length to ensure consistent input sizes.
- The tokenized inputs and labels are aligned for supervised training.

---

### 4. Defining Training Configuration

- Training arguments are set, including batch size, number of epochs, logging frequency, and output directories.
- These configurations control how the model will be fine-tuned, including how often the model saves progress and reports status.

---

### 5. Model Fine-Tuning

- The `Trainer` class from Hugging Face is used to manage the training loop.
- The model is trained on the tokenized dataset, adjusting its parameters to better map airline-related inputs to correct responses.

---

### 6. Model Evaluation

- After training, the fine-tuned model is evaluated by generating answers to the same set of instructions and inputs.
- The generated responses are compared against the expected outputs using a simple keyword matching technique.
- Overall accuracy is calculated as the proportion of examples where the model’s response contains the expected key terms.

---

## Summary

This fine-tuning process adapts a general-purpose language model to a specific domain (airline policies and FAQs), enabling it to generate precise and context-aware answers to user queries. The approach combines:

- Instruction-based prompting for clear input formatting.
- Tokenization for model compatibility.
- Supervised training to teach the model expected responses.
- Post-training evaluation to assess model quality.

This setup can serve as a foundation for developing specialized conversational agents in various domains by providing relevant training data and following similar fine-tuning steps.

---

## Next Steps

- Use a larger and more diverse dataset to improve the model’s understanding and response quality.
- Explore more sophisticated evaluation metrics beyond simple keyword matching.
- Deploy the fine-tuned model in a chatbot framework or API service for real-world use.
