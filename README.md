# ðŸ›« AI-Powered Airline Chatbot with Fine-Tuned LLM

This project fine-tunes a powerful open-source LLM on airline-specific customer queries to build a chatbot capable of handling tasks like booking flights, checking flight status, baggage policies, refunds, and more.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Fine-tune an open-source LLM model (`mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` or similar)
- Use PEFT (LoRA) for parameter-efficient, low-resource fine-tuning
- Custom dataset with 30+ real-world airline customer queries
- Evaluate fine-tuned model accuracy on test queries
- Easy-to-understand example notebook for training and inference
- Ready for deployment as a chatbot backend

---

### âœ… Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- GPU with CUDA support (for faster fine-tuning; CPU also works but slower)
- Hugging Face `transformers`, `datasets`, `peft`, `accelerate`, `trl` libraries
- Internet connection for downloading pre-trained models
